*You need to know how to install extensions in LioranBoard, you can follow [this](https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/setup.html#extensions) guide created by the amazing [Christinna](https://github.com/christinna9031)!*

â„¹ This extension comes with an with an **REQUIRED** deck. If you remove this 

â„¹ This extension comes with an example deck fully set up to see how you can use it. It is *not* required for full functionality.
