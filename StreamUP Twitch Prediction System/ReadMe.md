We shall now go over the numbers what they do and mean:

 1. These are example prediction buttons. You can freely open and edit this button. You can make as many copies of these buttons as you want so you can easily make premade default predictions for yourself. Inside the button is a small instruction available about what you can change. But it will also be covered in this documentation later on also.
 2. This is a blank button. Just to fill up some space. You can resize or delete this button and make some space for more prediction buttons if you want.
 3. These buttons are for picking a winning side. The extension will autofill the answers into this button and will show it on the Lioranboard stream deck application.Â²
 4. This button will retrieve the latest prediction information as how many channel points have been used and how many people have chosen a side. Â² Â³
 5. This button will lock an open predication before the timer is finished.Â²
 6. This button will cancel any open or locked prediction. Viewers will get their points back.Â²
 7. This button has some complex logic in it so that moderators and the streamer can make a prediction through Twitch chat. This feature was implemented so that mobile users can also create a prediction. This is not possible at the time of writing.Â²
 8. This button will make you go to the StreamUP website
 9. This button will make you go to this documentation
 10. This button will make you go to an awesome streamer called Silverlink and you should totally follow him ðŸ˜‰  

Â² **Please do not edit these buttons.  They are fully automated.**  
Â³ **This button only retrieves information when a prediction is created through this extension!**

# Editing the example prediction
This is where a big part of the magic happens. This button can be copied as many times as you want so that can create unlimited presets for your predictions.
