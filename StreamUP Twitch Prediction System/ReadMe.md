*You need to know how to install extensions in LioranBoard, you can follow [this](https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/setup.html#extensions) guide created by the amazing [Christinna](https://github.com/christinna9031)!*

ℹ This extension comes with an with an **REQUIRED** deck. If you remove this deck automatic updating will **NOT** work

ℹ This extension comes with an example deck fully set up to see how you can use it. It is *not* required for full functionality. You can create your buttons with these extension triggers and go ham with it 😊. I personally recommend you use the INIT button from the example deck though because this includes some logic that prevents double or multiple the same triggers.
